# OctoPrint-WorkAreaOutliner

## Description
This plugin adds an "Outline" button to preview the working area of a Gcode file.

If there is no bounding box in the gcode metadata, WorkAreaOutliner will manually calculate it.

## Slicer Metadata
If using a supported slicer program, this plugin can read the work area from the file metadata.

If metadata is not available, the work area will be automatically calculated.

### Supported Slicers:
- Cura
- PrusaSlicer
- SuperSlicer
- Slic3r
- Lightburn (inherited from OctoPrint-Framer, untested)
- Fusion360 (inherited from OctoPrint-Framer, untested)
